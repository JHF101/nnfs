# NNFS Demo

Demo application showcasing the usage of the library in a streamlit application.

The showcase consist of an application which allows the user
to select between all the configurable aspects of the library and construct a model to run and train.

Once training has been completed the models can then be used for inference or the models can be used and further fine tuned by starting training from a particular point.

The docker containers by default run on localhost where the default port the application runs on is port 8501.
