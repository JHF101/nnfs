# Neural Network from Scratch

"Neural Network from Scratch" is my implementation of a neural network starting from first principles. It includes both forward and backward propagations, along with a variety of gradient-based and non-gradient-based optimizers. The main goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of neural network mechanics. Over time, this project has evolved into a comprehensive library, equipped with tools like Docker to generate documentation, and a demo UI project designed to showcase the library's features in an accessible and interactive manner.

For more details, you can explore the [Neural Network from Scratch library documentation](library/nnfs_library.md).

## Documentation

The documentation is generated using `docker-compose.docs.yml`. A Docker container is utilized to generate document content, producing PDF and HTML pages. To access the documentation, refer to [NNFS Documentation](library/docs).

Additionally, you can find the documentation for the demo program at [Demo Documentation](program/nnfs_demo.md).

## Videos

I've prepared a video that offers a guided tour of the User Interface. This UI simplifies interactions with the neural network library by allowing modification of various network parameters. You can watch the video here: [User Interface Walkthrough](videos/Neural%20Networks%20From%20Scratch%20UI.mp4).

To visualize the network architecture, take a look at this graph: [Network Architecture Visualization](https://github.com/JHF101/nnfs/assets/63376348/8baaa871-5875-4679-acbf-a8faedb8e926).

Additionally, I've included a video showcasing the training, testing, and validation error and accuracy using a gradient-based algorithm known as the Delta-Bar-Delta optimizer. You can view the results here: [Training Results with Delta-Bar-Delta Optimizer](https://github.com/JHF101/nnfs/assets/63376348/fff8789a-c740-4f98-ac2b-0da3f8bffae9).

Lastly, there's a video demonstrating the use of a genetic algorithm, which is a non-gradient algorithm. This algorithm's evaluation parameter has been adjusted to use either error or accuracy as its fitness evaluation metric. Watch the video here: [Genetic Algorithm Demonstration](https://github.com/JHF101/nnfs/assets/63376348/d2b1fa2d-7d92-4ec3-97fd-65b4303c9e4d).
