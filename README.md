# Neural Network from Scratch

Neural Network from scratch is my first principles implementation of a neural network with forward and backward propagations with a number of different gradient and non-gradient based optimizers. The goal of this project was to become more familiar with the workings of a neural network. The project has evolved to the point where it is now a full-fledged library with tools such as docker which help generate documentation and a demo UI project made to showcase some of the features of the library in an easy to use and interactive format.

## Documentation

The documentation is generated by the `docker-compose.docs.yml`. A docker container generates the document content and places it in a pdf/html pages. [NNFS](library/docs)

The documentation for the demo program is [Demo Docs](program/nnfs_demo.md).
